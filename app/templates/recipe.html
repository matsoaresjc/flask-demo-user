Remove the brown oxtail and place in slow cooker. Add enough broth to cover the oxtail. Also toss in the marinade, tomatoes, and carrots. </li>
      <li>Set on high and cook for 7-8 hours. Until the meat becomes tender.
          Every hour check on the oxtail and keep oxtails slightly covered with liquid.
          At 6 hours, add the beans, tomato paste, and more of beef broth and/or water, if needed. Then simmer uncovered 1 hour, skimming fat off top and stirring occasionally. In the last 1/2 hour of cook time, season with 1- 2 tablespoons salt and fresh ground black pepper. Serve with rice and peas.

    <h4 class="media-heading">Jerk Chicken</h4>
    <ol>
  <li>Put vinegar, rum, hot peppers, onion, green onion tops, thyme, olive oil, salt, pepper, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and molasses into a blender. Pulse until mostly smooth. </li>
  <li>Place chicken in a large freezer bag, or in a large roasting pan or baking dish. Pour lime juice over the chicken and coat well. Add the jerk paste to the chicken pieces and coat well. Seal the bag or cover the chicken in the pan with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
  <li>When you are ready to cook the chicken, remove chicken from the marinade bag or pan. Put the remaining marinade into a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside to use as a basting sauce for the chicken.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Place chicken halves in a rimmed baking pan, skin side up. Roast until chicken halves are cooked through, about 50-60 minutes. The chicken is done when the juices run clear (not pink) when a knife tip is inserted into both the chicken breast and thigh, about 165-170°F for the breast and 180-185°F for the thigh. Transfer chicken to platter. Tent loosely with foil to keep warm and let stand 15 minutes.

Cut chicken into pieces. Serve with black beans and rice.</li>
